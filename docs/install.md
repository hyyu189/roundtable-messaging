# Installation and ownership

Roundtable installs into a versioned private Python environment and exposes
stable user-level commands. The installer owns only paths recorded in its
manifest and stops before overwriting an unrelated or locally modified path.

## Current status

The source-install path and extracted offline artifact pass automated
clean-home installation, repeated-install, conflict, command, harness-setup,
core-smoke, and uninstall tests. The artifact remains a release candidate until
the Codex SessionStart identity spike passes and real credentialed harness wake
tests plus the terminal UX matrix pass the promotion gates.

To preview the managed installer without touching a live installation, use
isolated paths:

```bash
mamba run -n general ./scripts/install.sh \
  --prefix /tmp/roundtable-preview \
  --link-dir /tmp/roundtable-preview-bin
```

## Layout

The default install creates:

- `~/.roundtable/versions/<version>`: the private virtual environment;
- `~/.roundtable/current`: the active version symlink;
- `~/.roundtable/bin`: stable command wrappers;
- `~/.roundtable/install-manifest.json`: owned paths and digests;
- `~/.roundtable/skills/shared/roundtable`: the canonical installed skill link;
- `~/.local/bin/rt-*`: user-visible links to the stable wrappers.

Project registries, runtime state, and project-local `.roundtable` mailboxes are
state, not versioned program files.

Harness onboarding is a second ownership layer. After
`roundtable-setup apply`, it also records:

- `~/.roundtable/harness-setup.json`: exact config fragments, links, and plist
  files owned by onboarding;
- `~/.roundtable/backups/harness-setup/`: private backups of existing config
  files before a managed merge;
- an owned Codex SessionStart fragment in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, when Codex is
  selected;
- `~/.claude/skills/roundtable`, `~/.hermes/skills/roundtable`, and/or
  `~/.codex/skills/roundtable`: selected harnesses' global discovery links to
  the one canonical installed skill.

Those global links mean a user does not download or copy the skill separately
for each new Roundtable project.

Stable wrappers export one absolute host-local runtime root. Set
`RT_RUNTIME_DIR` to override the default `<prefix>/.runtime`;
`RT_CODEX_RUNTIME_DIR` remains a compatibility alias. If both are present they
must name the same path, otherwise the command fails before launching a
harness. The installer and Codex LaunchAgents create this root with user-only
permissions. Keep a chosen override stable across setup and launch; changing it
requires an ownership-safe setup upgrade before Codex starts.

A single static custom `CODEX_HOME` is also supported when it is absolute,
owned, and below the selected user home. Codex setup puts the hook and global
skill link there and uses the matching app-server socket. Per-launch switching
between multiple auth homes remains outside the P0 lifecycle contract.

## New-user artifact journey

The host must already have CPython 3.11 through 3.14. The archive bundles the
Roundtable wheel and every Python package dependency, but not the interpreter;
stock macOS alone does not guarantee this prerequisite. If `python3` is not a
supported interpreter, set
`ROUNDTABLE_BOOTSTRAP_PYTHON=/absolute/path/to/python3`.

Then extract the release archive and run its installer. No source checkout,
build, or network dependency download is part of this path:

```bash
tar -xzf roundtable-messaging-<version>-macos.tar.gz
cd roundtable-messaging-<version>
./install
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # once per shell; persist it in your shell profile
roundtable
```

`roundtable` is the ordinary product entry. It selects or creates a project
folder, lists only seats whose harness executable is available (and marks
configured-but-missing harnesses unavailable), previews missing one-time
integration for the chosen harness, and asks before applying any owned
configuration. Git is optional and a project may be a non-code folder.

The equivalent standalone controls are intentionally explicit:

```bash
roundtable setup          # read-only preview
roundtable setup apply    # expert/scriptable apply
roundtable setup status
```

Running `roundtable setup` without `apply` never writes configuration, creates
runtime state, or invokes `launchctl`.

## Source install

Source installation requires CPython 3.11 through 3.14 with PyYAML, setuptools
77 or newer, and wheel available to the bootstrap interpreter. On the
development machine:

```bash
mamba run -n general ./scripts/install.sh
```

The source fallback builds a local project wheel without network access and
creates its private environment with access to the bootstrap interpreter's
PyYAML. Installation verifies that the command scripts and their managed
runtime helpers are both present and records their digests, so a same-version
reinstall cannot silently reuse a missing or locally modified lease helper.
This mode is for development and verification.

Verify the installed maildir core in an isolated HOME and PATH:

```bash
roundtable-smoke
```

The command exercises the common terminal baseline—send, inbox, quiet
acknowledgement, and drain—without touching the real registry, projects, or
daemon. Its isolated test environment loads no optional terminal adapter.

This core smoke deliberately does not use credentials, launch a real harness,
load a macOS service, or bind a Codex thread.

## Host onboarding details

The normal `roundtable` flow invokes the same planner for only the harness the
user selected. It displays the plan and requests confirmation before applying
it. To inspect all detected harnesses without launching one, run setup with no
subcommand:

```bash
roundtable-setup
```

That is the same as `roundtable-setup plan`: a read-only preflight that reports
which detected harnesses it would configure. It does not create runtime state,
write configuration, or invoke `launchctl`. `apply` and `status` also never
load or unload a service. Harnesses can be selected explicitly and repeatedly:

```bash
roundtable setup \
  --harness claude \
  --harness hermes \
  --harness codex
```

After reviewing the plan:

```bash
roundtable setup apply \
  --harness claude \
  --harness hermes \
  --harness codex
roundtable setup status
```

`apply` completes every collision and ownership check before its first
mutation, preserves pre-existing configuration, records private backups, and
is idempotent. It performs these harness-specific actions:

| Harness | Managed onboarding |
| --- | --- |
| Claude | Merges a SessionStart inbox wake hook and Stop drain gate into `~/.claude/settings.json`; links the global Roundtable skill |
| Hermes | Adds one marked `roundtable` plugin entry to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`; links the packaged plugin and global skill |
| Codex | Merges one SessionStart auto-bind hook into `~/.codex/hooks.json`; writes the app-server and wake-bridge plist files under `~/Library/LaunchAgents`; links the global skill |

Setup never installs Claude, Hermes, or Codex itself and never copies
credentials. It configures only harnesses already detected, unless
`--harness` is supplied explicitly.

Codex may require a one-time `/hooks` review before it trusts the installed
user-level SessionStart hook. That user decision cannot be automated and
Roundtable never bypasses it.

Setup writes service definitions but still never calls `launchctl`. The normal
Codex launcher performs a targeted service preflight afterward. When setup
writes a new app-server plist, it also writes a private, digest-bound pending
reload marker under `<prefix>/.runtime`; this prevents a still-responsive
same-version daemon from being mistaken for the newly configured service:

- `ready`: launch silently;
- `cold`: start an unambiguously absent or stopped app-server;
- `bridge_down`: restart only the wake bridge after validating the app-server;
- `reload_required_idle`: explain the drift and ask before a coordinated
  service-pair reload;
- `reload_deferred_busy`: refuse the reload because a Codex caller, active
  lease, unhealthy live lease, or ambiguous lease may be disrupted;
- `setup_required`, `unsupported`, or `unsafe`: fail closed without launching.

The preflight serializes repairs with a host lock, serializes its
marker/plist/manifest snapshot with the setup lock, and re-checks state after
acquiring both. A marked cold service is activated from the exact new plist and
the marker is then cleared; a responsive shared daemon still requires the
normal coordinated-reload decision. The low-level `rt-codex-daemon` and
`rt-codex-wake` commands remain recovery tools for expert diagnosis; they are
not steps in the normal onboarding journey.

## Project onboarding

The supported project-first entry for an interactive user is:

```bash
roundtable
```

Outside an anchored project, its menu offers registered Roundtable projects,
safe setup of the current or another existing folder, and creation of a new
folder. It then lists every configured Claude, Codex, and Hermes seat and
launches the selection with a fenced identity. It never offers the user's home
directory or the filesystem root as a project.

The scriptable project commands remain available:

```bash
roundtable init --here
roundtable init my-project
roundtable init my-git-project --git

# Equivalent low-level spelling:
roundtable-init --here
roundtable-init my-project
roundtable-init my-git-project --git
```

Initialization creates missing Roundtable files and appends clearly marked
blocks to supported existing orientation files. Repeating it is safe. No Git
repository is created by default; `--git` initializes and makes an initial
commit only when the target is not already inside a Git worktree. Existing
repositories and user-owned documents are preserved.

Once registered, launch from the project or use the interactive selector from
elsewhere:

```bash
roundtable claude
roundtable hermes
roundtable codex

# Low-level aliases:
rt-claude
rt-hermes
rt-codex
```

Roundtable Codex requires an initialized/registered project anchor. The anchor
is what lets the launcher claim a fenced seat under the host service lock and
lets SessionStart bind the correct native thread. The unanchored launcher
choice remains available for Claude and Hermes; use native `codex` directly
when no Roundtable project or messaging is wanted.

Claude's installed hooks and the Hermes plugin handle their native inbox wake
lifecycle. A fresh Codex thread normally binds without user input. The trusted
SessionStart hook writes an atomic request containing the native session ID,
cwd, and fence resolved from the launcher's private runtime intent, then
returns without making an app-server RPC. The wake bridge later validates the
exact thread ID, exact cwd, interactive source, root-thread status, and current
lease before committing the binding.

If diagnostics show that auto-bind was blocked or the hook has not yet been
trusted, manual binding remains available as a fallback:

```bash
rt-codex-wake bind /absolute/path/to/project
```

Manual bind is not part of the normal user journey. The current machine has not
yet run the live spike proving that Codex's hook `session_id` equals the
app-server thread ID and that the private runtime launch intent resolves to the
same current fenced lease. That spike and the real send-to-wake-to-drain/ack
path remain release promotion gates even though the configuration and queueing
paths are automated and tested.

## Offline release install

A generated release archive includes a `wheels/` directory containing the
Roundtable wheel and compatible PyYAML wheels. From the unpacked archive:

```bash
./install
```

Release mode uses `--no-index --only-binary` and does not download
dependencies. If an unpacked archive has a top-level `wheels/` directory,
`install.sh` selects it automatically.

See [Release artifact process](release.md) for locked inputs, deterministic
archive generation, checksums, and promotion gates.

## Upgrade gate

Installing a new version atomically advances `~/.roundtable/current`; stable
wrappers and owned LaunchAgent definitions use that path. A repeated
`roundtable setup apply` may update only plists and hook fragments whose old
digests are proven by the setup manifest; foreign drift still fails closed. A
running Codex app-server does not change executable in place.

On the next `roundtable` Codex launch, the service preflight compares the
selected CLI, running app-server, socket, wake bridge heartbeat, current plist
payloads, and every host-local Codex lease. It offers a coordinated reload only
when that snapshot is idle and asks before disruption. When any consumer may
still be live, it defers the reload and tells the user to close or resolve those
sessions first. `rt-doctor` remains the read-only diagnostic view.

## Uninstall

Harness configuration must be removed while the managed commands and canonical
skill still exist. If Codex was configured, its two jobs may have been loaded
after setup. Run teardown from Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, or another normal
shell outside Codex:

```bash
roundtable-setup status
roundtable-setup remove --unload-codex
roundtable-uninstall
```

The `--unload-codex` path refuses to run when `CODEX_THREAD_ID` says the caller
is inside Codex. It first verifies setup ownership, asks `launchctl` about only
`com.roundtable.codex-app-server` and `com.roundtable.codex-wake`, bootouts
either one only when loaded, and then deletes its managed plist files. A
Claude/Hermes-only setup uses plain `roundtable-setup remove` and never invokes
`launchctl`.

From an unpacked release, `./uninstall` can replace the last command. The
package uninstaller refuses to proceed while
`~/.roundtable/harness-setup.json` exists, which prevents dangling harness
configuration. Setup removal verifies owned fragments for drift, removes only
what setup added, and preserves unrelated user configuration. The package
uninstaller then verifies its own manifest ownership and digests before removal
and preserves:

- `~/.roundtable/projects.yaml` and its lock;
- global runtime state under `~/.roundtable/.runtime`;
- every project-local `.roundtable` mailbox and ledger.

`--purge-runtime` additionally removes the global ephemeral runtime directory.
It does not remove the registry or project data.
